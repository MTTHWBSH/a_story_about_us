Marry me darlin
===============
We stand before you today to witness the collaboration of two great PW's on the utmost of secret projects.

Over the course of May '13â€”July '13 or so, I've been secretly collaborating with one @mtthwbsh in a devious plan to convince his girlfriend to marry him. It worked.


Build Dependencies
------------
* Ruby/SASS
* Node/Grunt

Compiling assets
----------------
I've set up a Grunt config file to compile workable assets to their production versions (that means you'll need `npm` installed). You'll need to install `grunt-cli` and do `$npm install` to get going. Once done with that, there are several options for the CLI: `$grunt`, `$grunt sass`, `$grunt js`, `grunt sass-w`, `grunt js-w`, and `$grunt prod`.

By default `$grunt` compiles all assets unminified, then watches `sass/*.scss` && `js/*/*.js` for changes and recompiles. All grunt commands generate a source map for the sass and file separators for the scripts.

The `$grunt sass` && `$grunt js` commands compile only sass and js respectively and watch only those files for recompiling.

If you only want to compile specifically sass or js as a one-off, use `$grunt sass-w` (sass minus watch) or `$grunt js-w`.

For a one-off minified compile of all assets, `$grunt prod` is your man.

###JS
Dependency mangement on this is really primitive. Grunt cycles through files/directories in ascending alpha-numeric order, so if you have a script with dependencies, make sure the dependency's file path shows up before the script in question. For instance, all third party files are in `1-vend`, and all app-specific scripts are in `2-local`. jQuery is a dependency, but it's hosted on the Google CDN with a local fallback so it's not included in `love-story.js`.

Images
------
Go in the `www/img` directory. If you have workables, they should go in `pre/img`, which doesn't exist, but I'm sure you could figure out how to add it. If there is interest, I know Grunt has a tool for crunching `.png` files, but I don't feel the need to do that atm.
